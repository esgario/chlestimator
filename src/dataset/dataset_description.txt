 Estimation of Papaya Chlorophyll Content (EPCC) Dataset
_________________________________________________________________

 - DESCRIPTION:

 This dataset aims to estimate the chlorophyll content present in
 papaya leaves by means of common smartphone photos. The reference
 measurements present in the dataset were obtained with the SPAD-502
 device. Since the SPAD-502 is a reliable and widely used equipment
 in practice to collect approximate values of chlorophyll content in
 the field.

 So the development of this dataset was stimulated by the following
 hypothesis:

     "Images of conventional RGB cameras are sufficient to make an
      estimate of the chlorophyll content in leaves of plants."
